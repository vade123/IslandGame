# IslandGame

A school project done in pairs during TIE-02402 Ohjelmointi 3: Tekniikat. The project was originally done using the university's internal GitLab, from which the files were moved here. 

Everything in `GameLogic/` is written by the course staff and was updated during the course. `UI/` and `Tests/` contain the actual project work. `Documentation/` contains instructions for the game and information about our work process, in finnish.
